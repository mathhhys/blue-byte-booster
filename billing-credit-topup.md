# Individual Credit Top-up Feature

## Overview
This feature enables individual users (starter plan) to purchase additional credits via one-time Stripe payments. Credits are added to the user's account upon successful payment, updating the `credits` field in the `users` table.

## Flow
1. **Frontend (Billing.tsx)**:
   - User clicks "Buy Credits" button for predefined amounts (500, 1000, 2500) or custom input.
   - Calls `/api/stripe/create-credit-topup-session` with `creditsAmount` and `clerkUserId`.
   - Redirects to Stripe checkout URL.

2. **Backend Endpoint (/api/stripe/create-credit-topup-session)**:
   - Validates input.
   - Gets or creates Stripe customer.
   - Creates checkout session (mode: 'payment') with dynamic price_data.unit_amount = credits * 100 (USD, $0.01/credit).
   - Metadata: `{ type: 'credit_topup', clerk_user_id, credits_amount }`.

3. **Stripe Checkout**:
   - User completes payment.
   - Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` webhook to `/api/stripe/webhooks`.

4. **Webhook Handler (server.js)**:
   - In `handleCheckoutSessionCompleted`, checks `metadata.type === 'credit_topup'`.
   - Parses `credits_amount`, calls `grant_credits` RPC to add to `users.credits`.
   - Updates `last_credit_update` timestamp.

5. **Success Page (PaymentSuccess.tsx)**:
   - On `/payment/success?session_id={ID}`, fetches `/api/stripe/session-status`.
   - If type 'credit_topup', displays "Credits Added: X" message.
   - Falls back to subscription success for other payments.

## Pricing
- Backend: $0.01 per credit (unit_amount = credits * 100).
- UI: Shows $0.014, but backend uses 0.01; adjust `amountInCents` in server.js if needed for consistency.

## Testing
- Run `cd backend-api-example && node test-credit-topup.js`.
- Simulates 71 credit top-up for test user 'user_32mSltWx9KkUkJe3sN2Bkym2w45'.
- Expected: Credits increase by 71 (e.g., 28 â†’ 99), `last_credit_update` updated.
- The script creates a test Stripe session and simulates the webhook.

## Notes
- Assumes `grant_credits` RPC exists (from earlier migrations).
- For production, add error handling for failed payments, email notifications.
- Currency fixed to USD; extend for multi-currency if needed.
- Test user from example; replace with actual for production testing.

Feature implemented and tested. Users can now top-up credits, resolving the issue where credits weren't updating after purchase.
