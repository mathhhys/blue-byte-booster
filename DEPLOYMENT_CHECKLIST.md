# Token System Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
1. ‚úÖ Button now clickable (removed incorrect disabled condition)
2. ‚úÖ Module export errors fixed (converted to ES modules)
3. ‚úÖ Encryption made optional (works without ENCRYPTION_KEY)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration (REQUIRED)

The new tables and functions need to be created in your database.

**Option A: Via Supabase SQL Editor (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the entire contents of [`backend-api-example/migrations/20251008_enhance_token_system.sql`](backend-api-example/migrations/20251008_enhance_token_system.sql:1)
4. Paste and run it
5. Verify success (should create 2 new tables and several functions)

**Option B: Via Script**
```bash
cd backend-api-example
node run-migration.js 20251008_enhance_token_system.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment (REQUIRED)

Your code changes are ready, but Vercel needs to redeploy to pick them up.

**Push to Git** (if using Git integration):
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement comprehensive token system with audit logging and rate limiting"
git push
```

**Or Deploy Directly**:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Test Token Generation

After deployment:
1. Go to your dashboard at https://www.softcodes.ai/dashboard
2. Toggle "Use long-lived token"
3. Click "Generate Long-Lived (4 months) Token"
4. Token should be generated successfully

### Step 4: Add Encryption Key (OPTIONAL - For Production Security)

```bash
# Generate key
node scripts/generate-encryption-key.js

# Add to Vercel
vercel env add ENCRYPTION_KEY
# Paste the generated key when prompted

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

**Note**: The system works WITHOUT this key, but IP addresses and user agents won't be encrypted.

## üîç Current Status

### What's Working Now:
- ‚úÖ Button is clickable
- ‚úÖ Code is fixed and ready
- ‚úÖ All modules use ES module syntax
- ‚úÖ Encryption is optional

### What Needs Deployment:
- ‚è≥ Database migration must be run
- ‚è≥ Code must be deployed to Vercel
- ‚è≥ (Optional) Encryption key for production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why You're Getting 500 Error

The error occurs because:
1. **The new code is deployed** (Vercel picked it up automatically)
2. **But the database migration hasn't been run yet**
3. When the code tries to access `token_audit_logs` table, it doesn't exist
4. This causes the 500 Internal Server Error

**Solution**: Run the database migration (Step 1 above)

---

## üéØ Quick Fix (Temporary)

If you need token generation to work immediately before running the migration, you can temporarily disable the new features:

**Option: Revert to Old Generate Endpoint**
This would work but you'd lose all the new features. **NOT recommended** - just run the migration instead.

## üìä Verification Steps

After completing deployment:

1. **Check Migration**:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_name IN ('token_audit_logs', 'token_rate_limits');
   ```
   Should return 2 rows.

2. **Generate Token**:
   - Should work without errors
   - Should see token in response

3. **Check Logs**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM token_audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```
   Should show 'generated' action.

4. **Test Rate Limiting**:
   - Try generating 6 tokens quickly
   - 6th should fail with rate limit error

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Error: "token_audit_logs does not exist"
**Fix**: Run database migration (Step 1)

### Error: "increment_token_rate_limit does not exist"  
**Fix**: Run database migration (Step 1)

### Error: "ENCRYPTION_KEY not set"
**Fix**: This is just a warning. System works without it. Add key for production.

### Token generation works but no audit logs
**Fix**: Check if migration created the `token_audit_logs` table

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Check Supabase logs (Dashboard ‚Üí Logs)
3. Verify migration ran successfully
4. Check browser console for client errors
5. Check that all environment variables are set

---

**Next Action**: Run the database migration in Supabase SQL Editor to fix the 500 error.
