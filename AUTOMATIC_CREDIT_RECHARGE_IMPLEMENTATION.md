# Automatic Credit Recharge Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of automatic credit recharging for active subscription users with monthly 500 credits and yearly 6000 credits allocation.

## Current Analysis

### Credit Allocation Structure
- **Initial Purchase**: 500 credits per seat for both monthly and yearly
- **Missing**: Automatic recharge for recurring payments
- **Missing**: Different credit amounts for yearly subscriptions (should be 6000)

### Required Changes

#### 1. Stripe Webhook Handler (`/api/stripe/webhooks.js`)

**Events to Handle:**
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Recurring subscription payments
- `checkout.session.completed` - Initial subscription setup
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Plan changes
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Cancellations

**Credit Allocation Rules:**
- **Monthly Plans**: 500 credits per billing cycle per seat
- **Yearly Plans**: 6000 credits per billing cycle per seat
- **Initial Purchase**: Same as recurring (updated from current 500 for yearly)

#### 2. Helper Functions

**`distinguishPaymentType(invoice, subscription)`**
- Returns: 'initial' | 'recurring' | 'proration'
- Logic: Check if it's the first invoice for the subscription

**`calculateCreditsToGrant(planType, billingFrequency, seats)`**
- Monthly: 500 * seats
- Yearly: 6000 * seats

**`getUserFromStripeCustomer(customerId)`**
- Get Clerk user ID from Stripe customer metadata
- Fallback to database lookup by stripe_customer_id

#### 3. Database Functions (Extend existing)

**Enhanced `grant_credits` function:**
- Add payment_type parameter ('initial' | 'recurring')
- Add stripe_invoice_id for reference
- Better logging and error handling

#### 4. Webhook Security & Reliability

**Security:**
- Verify Stripe webhook signatures
- Validate event authenticity
- Rate limiting protection

**Reliability:**
- Idempotency handling (prevent double processing)
- Transaction rollback on errors
- Comprehensive logging
- Error notification system

#### 5. Testing Strategy

**Mock Data Testing:**
- Create test invoices for different scenarios
- Test initial vs recurring payment detection
- Test different plan types and billing frequencies

**Integration Testing:**
- Use Stripe CLI webhook forwarding
- Test with real webhook events
- Verify credit allocation accuracy

## Implementation Files

### New Files
1. `/api/stripe/webhooks.js` - Main webhook handler
2. `/api/stripe/webhook-helpers.js` - Utility functions
3. `/scripts/test-webhook-credit-allocation.js` - Testing script

### Updated Files
1. `/api/stripe/process-payment-success.js` - Update yearly credit allocation
2. `/backend-api-example/migrations/004_webhook_credit_enhancement.sql` - Database improvements

## Credit Allocation Flow

### Initial Purchase
```
Checkout Session Completed → Process Payment Success → Grant Credits
- Monthly: 500 credits
- Yearly: 6000 credits (UPDATED from 500)
```

### Recurring Payments
```
Invoice Payment Succeeded → Webhook Handler → Grant Credits
- Monthly: 500 credits every month
- Yearly: 6000 credits every year
```

### Edge Cases Handled
- Proration adjustments
- Plan upgrades/downgrades
- Seat changes
- Failed payments
- Subscription cancellations
- Multiple webhooks for same event (idempotency)

## Success Metrics
- Monthly users automatically receive 500 credits on billing cycle
- Yearly users automatically receive 6000 credits on billing cycle
- Zero duplicate credit grants
- 100% webhook event processing success rate
- Comprehensive audit trail for all credit allocations

## Security Considerations
- Webhook signature verification
- Request origin validation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure environment variable handling
- Error logging without sensitive data exposure

## Testing Results ✅

### Credit Calculation Tests
All credit calculation tests passed:
- ✅ Monthly Pro Plan - 1 seat: 500 credits
- ✅ Yearly Pro Plan - 1 seat: 6000 credits
- ✅ Monthly Teams Plan - 3 seats: 1500 credits
- ✅ Yearly Teams Plan - 5 seats: 30000 credits
- ✅ Monthly Pro Plan - 10 seats: 5000 credits
- ✅ Yearly Pro Plan - 2 seats: 12000 credits

### Payment Type Determination Tests
All payment type tests passed:
- ✅ Initial payment detection working correctly
- ✅ Recurring payment detection working correctly

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables Required
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...
```

### 2. Stripe Webhook Configuration
Configure these events in Stripe Dashboard:
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` (for recurring payments)
- `checkout.session.completed` (for initial payments)
- `customer.subscription.updated` (for plan changes)
- `customer.subscription.deleted` (for cancellations)

Webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhooks`

### 3. Testing Commands
```bash
# Test credit calculation logic
cd scripts && node test-credit-calculation.js

# Test with real Supabase (requires env vars)
cd scripts && node test-webhook-credit-allocation.js
```

### 4. Verification Steps
1. Create test subscription with monthly billing
2. Verify 500 credits granted initially
3. Wait for first recurring payment (or simulate)
4. Verify 500 credits added on recurring payment
5. Repeat for yearly plans (6000 credits)
