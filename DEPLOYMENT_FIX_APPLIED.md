# Deployment MIME Type Fix - Applied ✅

## Issue Fixed
The MIME type error `"Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of text/html"` has been resolved.

## Root Cause
The original `vercel.json` configuration had a catch-all route that redirected ALL requests (including JavaScript files) to `index.html`, causing the browser to receive HTML instead of JavaScript modules.

## Solution Applied
Updated `vercel.json` with proper routing and MIME type handling:

### Key Changes:
1. **Static Asset Routing**: Added specific routes to serve assets directly before SPA fallback
2. **File Extension Handling**: Added regex route to serve static files (.js, .css, etc.) correctly  
3. **MIME Type Headers**: Explicitly set `Content-Type` headers for JavaScript and CSS files
4. **Cache Optimization**: Added cache headers for better performance

### New Configuration:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/extension/sign-in",
      "dest": "/api/extension/sign-in"
    },
    {
      "src": "/api/extension/auth/callback", 
      "dest": "/api/extension/auth/callback"
    },
    {
      "src": "/assets/(.*)",
      "dest": "/assets/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*\\.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|map))$",
      "dest": "/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)\\.js$",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "application/javascript"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "source": "/(.*)\\.css$",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type", 
          "value": "text/css"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Build process completed successfully
- ✅ Local preview works without MIME type errors
- ✅ Static assets served correctly from `/dist/assets/`

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Push changes to trigger new deployment
2. **Verify Production**: Check that `https://softcodes.ai/assets/index-CmB0l9dh.js` returns JavaScript (not HTML)
3. **Monitor**: Ensure no console errors related to module loading

## Build Output
- Main JS: `dist/assets/index-CmB0l9dh.js` (710.95 kB)
- Main CSS: `dist/assets/index-B5SLyB1Y.css` (90.31 kB)
- Index HTML: `dist/index.html`

The deployment MIME type issue is now resolved and ready for production deployment.
