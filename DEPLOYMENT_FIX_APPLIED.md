# Vercel Deployment Fix Applied

## Issue
The deployment was failing with the error: "Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`."

## Root Cause
The `vercel.json` configuration was incorrectly trying to specify runtime configurations for functions that should be handled automatically by Vercel.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Updated vercel.json
- **Removed** the incorrect `functions` configuration block that was causing the runtime error
- **Fixed** rewrite paths to properly route extension authentication endpoints

### 2. Created Proper Vercel Serverless Functions
- **Moved** API routes from `src/api/extension/` to `api/extension/` (root level)
- **Converted** Next.js API routes to Vercel-compatible serverless functions using `@vercel/node`
- **Created** two main API endpoints:
  - `api/extension/sign-in.ts` - Handles VSCode extension sign-in initiation
  - `api/extension/auth/callback.ts` - Handles OAuth callback from Clerk

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Issues
- **Resolved** Clerk SDK compatibility issues in the callback function
- **Updated** session handling to work with the current Clerk SDK version

## File Structure Changes

### Before:
```
src/
  api/
    extension/
      sign-in/
        route.ts
      auth/
        callback/
          route.ts
```

### After:
```
api/
  extension/
    sign-in.ts
    auth/
      callback.ts
src/
  api/
    stripe.ts (unchanged - client-side utility)
```

## Verification
The deployment should now succeed without runtime configuration errors. The API endpoints will be available at:
- `/extension/sign-in` → `/api/extension/sign-in`
- `/extension/auth/callback` → `/api/extension/auth/callback`

## Dependencies
The serverless functions use:
- `@vercel/node` for Vercel compatibility
- `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` for authentication
- `@supabase/supabase-js` for database operations

All dependencies are already included in `package.json`.
