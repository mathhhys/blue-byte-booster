# Security Practices for Blue Byte Booster

## Environment Variables Security

### ✅ Current Protection Status
- [`.env`](.env) and [`backend-api-example/.env`](backend-api-example/.env) are properly listed in [`.gitignore`](.gitignore)
- All Stripe API keys and sensitive secrets have been removed from git history
- Placeholder values are now used in tracked `.env` files

### 🔐 Critical Security Rules

1. **NEVER commit real API keys or secrets to git**
   - Always use placeholder values like `your_stripe_secret_key_here` in tracked files
   - Keep real secrets in local `.env` files that are gitignored

2. **Before committing, always verify:**
   ```bash
   git status                    # Check what files are being tracked
   git diff --cached            # Review exact changes being committed
   grep -r "sk_live\|sk_test" . # Search for potential Stripe keys
   ```

3. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - **REVOKE the exposed Stripe keys immediately** in your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
     - Live Secret Key: `sk_live_51HVzsoH6gWxKcaTX[REDACTED]`
     - Webhook Secret: `whsec_[REDACTED]`
   - Generate new API keys for production use
   - Update your production environment with the new keys

### 🛡️ Additional Security Measures

1. **Enable GitHub Secret Scanning:**
   - Visit [Repository Security Settings](https://github.com/mathhhys/blue-byte-booster/settings/security_analysis)
   - Enable Secret Scanning to detect future exposures

2. **Use Git Hooks (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Pre-commit hook to prevent secret commits
   echo '#!/bin/sh\nif git diff --cached | grep -E "(sk_live|sk_test|whsec_)"; then\n  echo "❌ Detected potential API keys in commit!"\n  exit 1\nfi' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

3. **Environment Management:**
   - Keep a separate `.env.local` for your actual development secrets
   - Use environment variable injection in production (Vercel, Heroku, etc.)
   - Never hardcode secrets in source code

### 📝 Recovery Steps Completed
- ✅ Removed `.env` files from git history using `git filter-branch`
- ✅ Cleaned git references and garbage collected
- ✅ Force pushed clean history to remote repository
- ✅ Replaced sensitive values with safe placeholders
- ✅ Verified [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) properly excludes `.env` files

### 🚨 Next Steps
1. **Immediately revoke the exposed Stripe keys**
2. Generate new API keys in Stripe Dashboard
3. Update your local `.env` files with new keys (never commit them!)
4. Update production environment variables
